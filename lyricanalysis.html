  <h1>Lyric Analysis</h1>
  <p id="lyricintro">For this page I will be analyzing some of my favorite Taylor Swift lyrics. Unfortunately none of my friends are Taylor Swift fans so I have no one else to talk to about this besides you, the reader. Enjoy!</p>
  <section id="tolerateit">
    <h2 class="cursivefont">tolerate it</h2>
    <h4>from the album <em>Evermore</em></h4>
    <blockquote class="centered">
      <p>If it's all in my head, tell me now</p>
      <p>Tell me I've got it wrong somehow</p>
      <p>I know my love should be celebrated</p>
      <p>But you tolerate it</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is common to have anxiety about your partner's feelings for you when you're in a relationship. It would be nice to get some reassurance that they still care for you. When you feel like your love is not being reciprocated or appreciated, it seems like your partner is forcing themselves to accept your love. I feel like Taylor really put into words what it feels like to be such a big lover and hopeless romantic in a relationship with someone who is emotionally unavailable.
    <blockquote class="centered">
      <p>I made you my temple, my mural, my sky</p>
      <p>Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You can make your partner literally the center of your world, but that doesn't mean they'll do the same for you. Now that the relationship is over, it's clear that their memory will have a large impact on you, but your ex will likely choose to barely remember your time together. Everyone knows that breakups suck; they suck even more when the other person shows that they don't care about you anymore.</p>

  <section id="cardigan">
    <h2 class="cursivefont">cardigan</h2>
    <h4>from the album <em>Folklore</em></h4>
    <blockquote class="centered">
      <p>And when I felt like I was an old cardigan</p>
      <p>Under someone's bed</p>
      <p>You put me on and said I was your favorite</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There are times in our lives where we feel like no one cares about us. Then out of no where someone comes into our lives and makes us feel like the most important person in the world.</p>
    <blockquote class="centered">
      <p>To kiss in cars and downtown bars</p>
      <p>Was all we needed</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes the thing you are missing in your relationship can be so simple, but your partner might not be willing to even put that little bit of effort.</p>
    <blockquote class="centered">
      <p>You drew stars around my scars</p>
      <p>But now I'm bleedin'</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Your partner can come into your life and help you forget about all your sorrows, then they could leave you with even more pain than before. I love the imagery in this lyric. I feel like it's such a beautifully sad way to describe the emotional pain of a breakup.</p>
    <blockquote class="centered">
      <p>But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss</p>
      <p>I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs</p>
      <p>The smell of smoke would hang around this long</p>
      <p>Cause I knew everything when I was young</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These lyrics are all unique ways of explaining how difficult you know it will be to forget about your ex, particularly if it was a young romance. We think we know everything when we are young, but really we are still naive, discovering ourselves, and learning how to live.
